        <h2>Git Problems</h2>
        <h3>First I wanted to define a git merge.</h3>
        <p>One of the first thinsg that popped up was <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-does-Git-merge-work">Quora</a>. This site stated "Merge commits have two or more parents. Every git commit is composed of a "tree", one or more "parents", author name, email, date and committer name, email, date. The only difference between a merge commit and normal commit is the number of parents.</br>
        While <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge">"This command is used by git pull to incorporate changes from another repository and can be used by hand to merge changes from one branch into another." In a <a href="https://github.com/LynnaS/programming_resources/edit/master/git_problem">different place</a> they stated "Join two or more development histories together".</br>
        And <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-merge">atlassian</a> describes it as "Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch."</p>
        
        <h3>What I found out about merging.</h3>
        <p>From <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-merge">atlassin</a> I found out that there are two different types of merges: Fast-forward and 3-way.</p>
        <p>Fast-forward merges are for "when there is a linear path from the current branch tip to the target branch." This means that the master has not changed since the new branch was made. It is not really a merge but nore like an integration of the new branch into the master. The site also adds that it is better for an isolated approach and not for longer running stuff that is more complicated.</br>
        They also said that if the change is really small that you are better off rebasing the master and then doing a fast-forward merge. You use <git rebase master> to take all the changes that were committed on the master and to replay them on the branch. It goes to the ancester of the two branches, gets the changes, temporarily saves, then applies each change in turn. Then you can do a simple fast-forward merge.They say that this makes for a cleaner history as all the changes just line up in a linear history.</br>
        This is the format they gave.</br>
            # Start a new feature</br>
            git checkout -b new-feature master</br>
            # Edit some files</br>
            git add <file></br>
            git commit -m "Start a feature"</br>
            # Edit some files</br>
            git add <file></br>
            git commit -m "Finish a feature"</br>
            # Merge in the new-feature branch</br>
            git checkout master</br>
            git merge new-feature</br>
            git branch -d new-feature</p>
            
          <p>3-way merges are for committing the 2 branch tips and their common ancestor.The two branches have both made changes. This is used for large features or for when multiple people are working simultaniously. /br>
          This is the format they gave.</br>
            # Start a new feature</br>
            git checkout -b new-feature master</br>
            # Edit some files</br>
            git add <file></br>
            git commit -m "Start a feature"</br>
            # Edit some files</br>
            git add <file></br>
            git commit -m "Finish a feature"</br>
            # Develop the master branch</br>
            git checkout master</br>
            # Edit some files</br>
            git add <file></br>
            git commit -m "Make some super-stable changes to master"</br>
            # Merge in the new-feature branch</br>
            git merge new-feature</br>
            git branch -d new-feature</p>
            
         <p>Resolving conflicts in a 3-way merge is done by git stopping the merge and you fixing it manually. If you run a <git status> it will tell you which files have both been changed. You would see something like this:</br>
            # On branch master</br>
            # Unmerged paths:</br>
            # (use "git add/rm ..." as appropriate to mark resolution)</br>
            #</br>
            # both modified: hello.py</br>
            #</br>
            Then you fix the problem and <git add theconflictedfileorfiles>. This tells git that the problem is resolved. Then do a regular commit.</p
        
        <h2>Git-scm</h2>
        <p><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging">Git-scrm</a> also had lots of information.However, I didn't find this site particularly user friendly for a beginner.</p>

        <h2>Stackoverflow</h2>
        <p>A <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5601931/best-and-safest-way-to-merge-a-git-branch-into-master">Stackoverflow</a> answers all say that their answer is the best and safest way to merge. </br>
        The question is....</br>
        You have a master.</br>
        There are several branches. Yours is called "test".</br>
        You work for several days on test. You keep up to date by doing <git pull origin master> while you are in your branch test. </br>
        Is this correct?</p>

        <p>One answer suggested the code below but also talked about "--rebase".</br>
            git checkout master</br>
            git pull origin master</br>
            git merge test</br>
            git push origin master</p>

         <p>The next answer says not to do this because we can't see if there are any conflicts and that it would lump all the test commits together and you could not see all the different changes you have done. If you think that there might be conflicts you should do this instead.</br>
                git checkout test</br>
                git pull </br>
                git checkout master</br>
                git pull</br>
                git merge --no-ff --no-commit test       (the noff avoids a fastforward merg)</br>
                Any conflicts? check out with <git status></br>
            Then we commit and push</br>
                git commit -m 'merge test branch'</br>
                git push</br>
            But this way we loose history and makes it harder for others to follow. Best thing to do is to rebase and not merge.</br>
            For a simple thing do below, for advanced go to <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing">git-scrm</a></br>
                git checkout master</br>
                git pull</br>
                git checkout test</br>
                git pull</br>
                git rebase -i master</br>
                git checkout master</br>
                git merge test</br>
            It says to never use with the master. In other words NEVER DO THIS:</br>
                git checkout master</br>
                git rebase -i test</p>

            <h2>Atlassian again</h2>
            <p>Then there was a link to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing">Atlassian</a></br>
            The simplest thing is to merge the master into your branch called "feature" like this:</br>
                git checkout feature</br>
                git merge master</br>
            Or, you can condense this to a one-liner:</br>
                git merge master feature</br>
            However, you can mess up the history of the master if this is a busy site.
            </p>
            <p>An alternative is to Rebase.</br>
                git checkout feature</br>
                git rebase master</br>
            This does not use a merge commit but "re-writes the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch.</br>
            Now you have a perfectly linear project history!</br>
            There is even interactive rebasing that cleans up project history before you merge your work.</p>

        <p>GOLDEN RULE OF REBASING is to never use it on public branches. Ask yourself if anyone else is using this branch. Yes? Don't rebase!</p>
        
        <h2>My Team<h/2>
        <p>My team has been using the fast-forward method. We pull down our master, add our changes, and push it back up to github.</p>
